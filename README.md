# Sports-Spots-
Sports franchises are not only valuable, but they often become integral to the identity of the cities they represent. These “big league” teams usually inhabit only the largest cities to ensure there are plenty of fans nearby to buy tickets and jerseys! The NFL, NBA, MLB, MLS, and NHL have different demographics and they don’t always inhabit the same cities.

 

For this week’s challenge, use the 5 datasets provided to find the cities that do not have a team from all 5 leagues.

 

Your output should list the teams and their leagues for those cities. Note that some of the city information is missing a state, but you can grab those missing values from another dataset that has the same city!
